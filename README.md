**Project Overview**
This project analyzes vendor-level procurement and sales data to evaluate supplier performance, profitability, and inventory efficiency. The goal is to identify high-performing vendors, detect margin risks, and provide actionable insights for procurement and business decision-making.

**Business Objectives**
Evaluate vendor profitability and contribution
Identify high-dependency vendors
Detect low-margin high-sales vendors
Analyze unsold capital and inventory efficiency
Support data-driven procurement strategy

**Key Insights**
A small group of vendors contributes a significant portion of total purchases (supplier concentration risk).
Some high-sales vendors operate at low profit margins (negotiation opportunity).
Identified $2.7M unsold capital indicating potential inventory optimization areas.
Profit margin distribution varies significantly across vendor segments.
